* Given the little Mario game provided, make Mario walk Left and Right, when the user press L and R, respectively.
* Use the Left/Right images provided with the files in this assignment. 
* When the user presses L or R, we should see Mario turn left or right and move that way for a little distance (whatever you think), and then turn back and face forwards again. 
* Alter Mario's starting position to be at the ground level rather than the clouds. Alter the code so that the jumping capability is restored once the starting position has been moved. (Currently he jumps out of the cloud to start)
* Backgound music has been supplied, add code to play after web page is loaded. (OPTIONAL)
* I have placed TODO comments in the code where you will need to add your own code.
